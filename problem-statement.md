# Library Management System

## Description

Build a backend API for managing a library's book inventory. The system should handle standard book management and also process notifications for users when a wishlisted book is returned.

---

## Requirements

### CRUD Operations for Books

- **Create:** Add a new book with fields like `title`, `author`, `isbn`, `publishedYear`, and `availabilityStatus`.
- **Read:** Retrieve a paginated list of books with optional filters (e.g., by author, publishedYear).
- **Update:** Edit book details. A key use case is updating `availabilityStatus` when a book is borrowed or returned.
- **Delete:** Remove a book from the inventory.

### Search

Implement an endpoint to search for books by title or author using partial matching.

### Validation

- No duplicate `isbn` allowed.
- `publishedYear` must be a valid year.

### Asynchronous Wishlist Notification

When a book's status is updated from `Borrowed` to `Available`, the API must trigger a background task. This task will:

- Find all users who have wishlisted that specific book.
- Log a notification message for each user, e.g.:
  ```
  Notification prepared for user_id {id}: Book '{Title}' is now available.
  ```

The API call that updates the book's status must return a response quickly, **without waiting** for this notification logic to complete.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Clean API design** — RESTful principles, proper HTTP status codes.
- **Efficient database queries and schema design.**
- **Error handling and input validation.**
- **Knowledge of pagination and search optimization.**
- **Audit Trail** — Implement soft deletes.
- **Asynchronous Processing** — A clear and logical implementation of the decoupled notification task.
